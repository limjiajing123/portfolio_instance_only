REHABILITATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF SINGAPORE (RRIS) & NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY as a Undergraduate student researcher from AUG 2023 - MAY 2024
Final Year Project 
Project Title: Evaluating Navigation Among Crows Algorithm For Shared Control Of A Robotic Wheelchair
(Grade: A) in C++ and Python
    • Surveyed existing autonomous navigation among crowd algorithms.
    • Integration of an existing algorithm modified for shared control and evaluate its performance in simulator.
    • Created and modified GUI and visualization tool in Rviz to showcase the effects of the algorithm.
    • Make recommendations for the best algorithm to use for shared control amongst crowd.
    • Creation of a pipeline to test shared control amongst crowd algorithms in simulator. 
    • Proven that Navigation Among Crowd Algorithm considering dynamic obstacle is unnecessary.

ST Engineering Land Systems, Singapore from June 2023 to August 2023
Robotics Software Intern 
    • Developed robotics software in C++, Python, and Golang, contributing to autonomous robot navigation using ROS 1/2, SLAM systems.
    • Integrated and customized SLAM algorithms (Cartographer, Gmapping) by ingesting Velodyne LiDAR data, using Wireshark to verify and troubleshoot sensor-level network communication. Developed data-processing functions to optimize and format point clouds for accurate 2D/3D mapping.
    • Created RViz plugins and utilities allowing users to interactively define virtual map boundaries, generating dynamic point cloud walls to confine robot navigation within user-defined zones.
    • Extracted and processed IMU data (heading, roll, pitch, yaw) for the SPYDER hull-climbing robot, integrating readings into ROS and visualizing live orientation in RViz for real-time feedback and client demonstration.
    • Developed Go executables and containerized multiple microservices (e.g., GUIAPI, MySQL, FleetAPI, health checks) into Docker images and containers with static IPs on a private Docker network, enabling secure and reliable inter-service communication.
